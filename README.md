# About this project

In this project I wanted to replicate the structure, styles and function of the new user interface developed by PlayStation for they latest gaming console PS5

Of course this is far from their awesome user experience but in some ways (because of the resource and time limitation) I managed to complete a section of the work I can say I'm proud of.

You can find the online demo here https://ps5.edalgrin.com
